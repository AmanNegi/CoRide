## Inspiration ✨
As the theme of this hackathon was Automobiles, I looked at the problems we face because of automobiles. We all know that automobiles play a vital role in our daily life, so it is illogical to ask people to not use vehicles. However, using vehicles wisely is something we can promote.

## Idea 💡
The basic idea is to reduce the number of vehicles traveling on road. Often, we drive alone in a vehicle with the capacity of more than one person. I wanted to solve this issue, as we could take more people along with us if they knew where my destination is.  Ultimately, the goal is to promote more sustainable transportation practices and reduce the negative impact of automobiles on the environment.

## What Co-Ride does 🤷‍♀️
Co-Ride is an app that helps connect people who are traveling in the same direction. The aim of the service is to reduce the number of single-occupancy vehicles on the road, thereby reducing air pollution, fuel consumption, and carbon emissions. By sharing rides, users can save money on transportation costs, reduce traffic congestion, and build a sense of community. The CoRide app allows users to easily find and connect with other riders who are going in the same direction, offering a convenient and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional transportation options.

## How we built it 👩‍🔧
I build it using Flutter, and Google Maps Services, and for design and editing, I used Figma and Premiere Pro.

## Challenges we ran into 👷‍♂️
- I had to work alone on all the components, as most of the hackers were either having exams or were going for HackThisWeek.
- Google Maps Routes API does not allow its use without putting in Credit Card Details, so I was unable to set this up.

## What we learned 📝
- I learned how to set up Google Maps and Geocoding which were having some errors at the initial stages.
- I also learned how to add custom markers and points to the Googe Map.

## What's next for Co-Ride 🔮
CoRide could explore partnerships with other transportation providers, such as public transit systems, to offer an integrated solution for users. CoRide could explore adding new features to its platform, such as real-time tracking, in-app payment systems, and social networking capabilities, to enhance the user experience and drive engagement.
